## Abstract

This EIP offers a standard for building a bit-based permission and role system. Each permission is represented by a single bit. By using an `uint256`, up to $256$ permissions and $2^{256}$ roles can be defined. We are able to specify the importance of permission based on the order of the bits.

## Motivation

Currently permission and access control are done using `string` or `keccak256(string)` comparaisons (see [ERC-5982](./eip-5982.md)).
By using bitwise and bitmask operations to determine access rights, we gain in efficiency, flexibility and more.

### Gas cost efficiency

Bitwise operations are very cheap and fast. For example, doing an `AND` bitwise operation on a permission bitmask is significantly cheaper than calling any number of `LOAD` opcodes.

### Flexibility

With the 256 bits of the `uint256`, we can create up to 256 different permissions which leads to $2^{256}$ unique combinations (a.k.a. roles).
*(A role is a combination of multiple permissions).* Not all roles have to be predefined.

Since permissions are defined as powers of two, we can use the binary OR operator to create new role based on multiple permissions.

### Ordering permissions by importance

We can use the most significant bit to represent the most important permission, the comparison between permissions can then be done easily since they all are `uint256`s.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

*Note* The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.8.7` (or above)

- Permission and role MUST be defined as an `uint256`
- Permission MUST be defined as a power of two
- Permission MUST be unique
- `0` MUST be used for none permission

## Rationale

Needs discussion.

## Reference Implementation

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

/**
    @title EIP-6617 Bit Based Permission
    @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6617
*/
library EIP6617 {
    /**
        @notice Check if _permission is a superset of _requiredPermission
        @param _permission          The given permission
        @param _requiredPermission  The required permission
        @return                     True if the _permission is a superset of the _requiredPermission else False
    */
    function permissionCheck(uint256 _permission, uint256 _requiredPermission)
        internal
        pure
        returns (bool)
    {
        return _permission & _requiredPermission == _requiredPermission;
    }

    /**
        @notice Add permission
        @param _permission          The given permission
        @param _permissionToAdd		The permission that will be added
        @return                     The new permission with the _permissionToAdd
    */
    function permissionGrant(uint256 _permission, uint256 _permissionToAdd)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return _permission | _permissionToAdd;
    }

    /**
        @notice Remove permission
        @param _permission          The given permission
        @param _permissionToRemove	The permission that will be removed
        @return                     The new permission without the _permissionToRemove
    */
    function permissionRevoke(uint256 _permission, uint256 _permissionToRemove)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return (_permission | _permissionToRemove) ^ _permissionToRemove;
    }
}
```

### Usage

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

import "EIP6617.sol";

contract Test {
	using EIP6617 for uint256;

	const PERMISSION_NONE = 0;
	const PERMISSION_READ = 1;     // 2⁰
	const PERMISSION_WRITE = 2;    // 2¹
	const PERMISSION_EXECUTE = 4;  // 2²

	// Role operator = 1 | 2 = 3
	const ROLE_OPERATOR = PERMISSION_READ | PERMISSION_WRITE;

	// Role admin = 1 | 2 | 4 = 7
	const ROLE_ADMIN = PERMISSION_READ | PERMISSION_WRITE | PERMISSION_EXECUTE;

  	function testPermissions() external pure returns (uint256) {
    	uint256 userPermission;

		// adding read permission
    	userPermission = userPermission.permissionGrant(PERMISSION_READ);
    	
		// adding admin role
		userPermission = userPermission.permissionGrant(ROLE_ADMIN);

		// removing execute permission
    	userPermission = userPermission.permissionRevoke(PERMISSION_EXECUTE);
    	
		// Checking permission
		if (userPermission.permissionCheck(ROLE_ADMIN)) {
      		// Only admin can access this part
    	}

    	return userPermission;
  	}
}
```
