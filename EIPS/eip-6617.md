## Abstract

This EIP offers a standard for building a bit-based permission and role system. Each permission is represented by a single bit. By using an `uint256`, up to $256$ permissions and $2^{256}$ roles can be defined. We are able to specify the importance of permission based on the order of the bits.

## Motivation

Currently permission and access control are done using `string` or `keccak256(string)` comparaisons (see [ERC-5982](./eip-5982.md)).
By using bitwise and bitmask operations to determine access rights, we gain in efficiency, flexibility and more.

### Gas cost efficiency

Bitwise operations are very cheap and fast. For example, doing an `AND` bitwise operation on a permission bitmask is significantly cheaper than calling any number of `LOAD` opcodes.

### Flexibility

With the 256 bits of the `uint256`, we can create up to 256 different permissions which leads to $2^{256}$ unique combinations (a.k.a. roles).
*(A role is a combination of multiple permissions).* Not all roles have to be predefined.

Since permissions are defined as powers of two, we can use the binary OR operator to create new role based on multiple permissions.

### Ordering permissions by importance

We can use the most significant bit to represent the most important permission, the comparison between permissions can then be done easily since they all are `uint256`s.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

_Note_ The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.8.7` (or above)

- Permission and role MUST be defined as an `uint256`
- Permission MUST be defined as a power of two
- Permission MUST be unique
- `0` MUST be used for none permission

### Defining new permissions and roles

```text
const PERMISSION_NONE = 0;
const PERMISSION_READ = 1;     // 2⁰
const PERMISSION_WRITE = 2;    // 2¹
const PERMISSION_EXECUTE = 4;  // 2²

// Role operator = 1 | 2 = 3
const ROLE_OPERATOR = PERMISSION_READ | PERMISSION_WRITE;

// Role admin = 1 | 2 | 4 = 7
const ROLE_ADMIN = PERMISSION_READ | PERMISSION_WRITE | PERMISSION_EXECUTE;
```

### Checking permission

To verify if owned permissions are a superset of required permissions, you need to apply a bitmask of `requiredPermission` to the `ownedPermission`.
 
```text
ownedPermission & requiredPermission == requiredPermission
```
